<u><a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/academic-services/undergraduate-students/academic-matters/course-registration-(stars)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STARS</a></u> (Student Automated Registration System) is the platform students use to plan their course timetable and register for courses <b>before</b> the semester starts.<br/><br/>
For Year 1 students, courses are pre-registered for both Semester 1 and Semester 2. Meaning to say students don't have to do anything to register for their courses. However, you may still participate in the Add/Drop Period to:
<ul class="list-disc pl-6">
  <li>Add or remove modules</li>
  <li>Switch indexes</li>

The Add/Drop Period usually occurs during the first two weeks of the semester.<br/><br/>
